        This is my new homepage. Looking to do 
        something that fits my style. 
        I am really excited about the carousel. It took a ton of thought! 
        Each image will be a link to one of my musings. 
        I am making two more carousels which will link to some articles
        i am writing. The final one will have links to projects 
        i am working on. Going to knock out the hamburger menu
        on saturday. As for the carousel, I have to decide what option 
        I am going to use for responsiveness. Should be fun!!! Also, check out the
        dot on the upper right hand corner. Used some js for this and decided to
        do more than just dark and light mode. Cheers! Oh and feel free to 
        check out my code on github.
