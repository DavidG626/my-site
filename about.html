        my name is david gutierrez. this is my new homepage. 
        looking to do something that fits my style. 
        i am really excited about the carousel. it took a 
        ton of thought! each image will be a link to one of 
        my musings. i might make two more carousels or sliders 
        which will link to some articles i am writing. the final 
        one will have links to projects i am working on. going 
        to knock out the hamburger menu on saturday. as for 
        the carousel, i have to decide what options i am going 
        to use for responsiveness. should be fun!!! 
        also, check out the dark/light mode on the upper right hand 
        corner. used some js for this and decided to
        do more than just dark and light mode. 
        cheers! oh and feel free to contact me davidguticodes@gmail.com. i'll keep you guys posted.
